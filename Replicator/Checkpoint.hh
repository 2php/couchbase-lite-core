    /**
     * Tracks the state of replication, i.e. which sequences have been sent/received and which
     * haven't. This state is persisted by storing a JSON serialization of the Checkpoint into
     * a pair of documents, one local and one on the server. At the start of replication both
     * documents are read, and if they agree, the replication continues from that state, otherwise
     * it starts over from the beginning.
     *
     * The local (push) state is essentially a set of sequences, represented as three values:
     * - `minSequence`, also just called the "checkpoint". All sequences less than or equal to
     *   this are known to have been pushed.
     * - `maxSequence`, the maximum sequence seen by the pusher. All sequences greater than
     *   this have, obviously, not been pushed.
     * - `pending`, a set of sequences in the range [minSequence, maxSequence) that are known but
     *   have not yet been pushed.
     *
     * The remote (pull) state is simpler, just one sequence. This is a _server-side_ sequence,
     * which is not an integer but a string, known to be JSON-encoded but otherwise opaque.
     * Since these sequences cannot be ordered and may occupy much more space, we don't
     * attempt to keep track of the exact set of pulled sequences. Instead, we just remember a
     * single sequence which has the same interpretation as `minSequence` does: this sequence
     * and all earlier ones are known to have been pulled. That means the replicator can start
     * by asking the server to send only sequences newer than it.
